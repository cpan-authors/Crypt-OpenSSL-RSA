# NAME

Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA - RSA encoding and decoding, using the openSSL libraries

# SYNOPSIS

    use Crypt::OpenSSL::Random;
    use Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA;

    # not necessary if we have /dev/random:
    Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_seed($good_entropy);
    Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->import_random_seed();
    $rsa_pub = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->new_public_key($key_string);
    $ciphertext = $rsa->encrypt($plaintext);

    $rsa_priv = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->new_private_key($key_string);
    $plaintext = $rsa->decrypt($ciphertext);

    $rsa = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->generate_key(1024); # or
    $rsa = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->generate_key(1024, $prime);

    print "private key is:\n", $rsa->get_private_key_string();
    print "public key (in PKCS1 format) is:\n",
          $rsa->get_public_key_string();
    print "public key (in X509 format) is:\n",
          $rsa->get_public_key_x509_string();

    $rsa_priv->use_md5_hash(); # insecure. use_sha256_hash or use_sha1_hash are the default
    $signature = $rsa_priv->sign($plaintext);
    print "Signed correctly\n" if ($rsa->verify($plaintext, $signature));

# SECURITY

Version 0.35 makes the use of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding a fatal error.  It is
very difficult to implement PKCS#1 v1.5 padding securely.  If you are still
using RSA in in general, you should be looking at alternative encryption
algorithms.  Version 0.36 implements RSA-PSS padding (PKCS#1 v2.1) and makes
setting an invalid padding a fatal error.  Note, PKCS1\_OAEP can only be used
for encryption and PKCS1\_PSS can only be used for signing.

# DESCRIPTION

`Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA` provides the ability to RSA encrypt strings which are
somewhat shorter than the block size of a key.  It also allows for decryption,
signatures and signature verification.

_NOTE_: Many of the methods in this package can croak, so use `eval`, or
Error.pm's try/catch mechanism to capture errors.  Also, while some
methods from earlier versions of this package return true on success,
this (never documented) behavior is no longer the case.

# Class Methods

- new\_public\_key

    Create a new `Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA` object by loading a public key in
    from a string containing Base64/DER-encoding of either the PKCS1 or
    X.509 representation of the key.  The string should include the
    `-----BEGIN...-----` and `-----END...-----` lines.

    The padding is set to PKCS1\_OAEP, but can be changed with the
    `use_xxx_padding` methods.

    Note, PKCS1\_OAEP can only be used for encryption.  You must specifically
    call use\_pkcs1\_pss\_padding (or use\_pkcs1\_pss\_padding) prior to signing
    operations.

- new\_private\_key

    Create a new `Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA` object by loading a private key in
    from an string containing the Base64/DER encoding of the PKCS1
    representation of the key.  The string should include the
    `-----BEGIN...-----` and `-----END...-----` lines.  The padding is set to
    PKCS1\_OAEP, but can be changed with `use_xxx_padding`.

    An optional parameter can be passed for passphase protected private key:

    - passphase

        The passphase which protects the private key.

- generate\_key

    Create a new `Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA` object by constructing a
    private/public key pair.  The first (mandatory) argument is the key
    size, while the second optional argument specifies the public exponent
    (the default public exponent is 65537).  The padding is set to
    `PKCS1_OAEP`, but can be changed with use\_xxx\_padding methods.

- new\_key\_from\_parameters

    Given [Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt%3A%3AOpenSSL%3A%3ABignum) objects for n, e, and optionally d, p,
    and q, where p and q are the prime factors of n, e is the public
    exponent and d is the private exponent, create a new
    Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA object using these values.  If p and q are
    provided and d is undef, d is computed.  Note that while p and q are
    not necessary for a private key, their presence will speed up
    computation.

- import\_random\_seed

    Import a random seed from [Crypt::OpenSSL::Random](https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt%3A%3AOpenSSL%3A%3ARandom), since the OpenSSL
    libraries won't allow sharing of random structures across perl XS
    modules.

# Instance Methods

- DESTROY

    Clean up after ourselves.  In particular, erase and free the memory
    occupied by the RSA key structure.

- get\_public\_key\_string

    Return the Base64/DER-encoded PKCS1 representation of the public
    key.  This string has
    header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY------
        -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY------

- get\_public\_key\_x509\_string

    Return the Base64/DER-encoded representation of the "subject
    public key", suitable for use in X509 certificates.  This string has
    header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY------
        -----END PUBLIC KEY------

    and is the format that is produced by running `openssl rsa -pubout`.

- get\_private\_key\_string

    Return the Base64/DER-encoded PKCS1 representation of the private
    key.  This string has
    header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY------
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY------

    2 optional parameters can be passed for passphase protected private key
    string:

    - passphase

        The passphase which protects the private key.

    - cipher name

        The cipher algorithm used to protect the private key. Default to
        'des3'.

- encrypt

    Encrypt a binary "string" using the public (portion of the) key.

- decrypt

    Decrypt a binary "string".  Croaks if the key is public only.

- private\_encrypt

    Encrypt a binary "string" using the private key.  Croaks if the key is
    public only.

- public\_decrypt

    Decrypt a binary "string" using the public (portion of the) key.

- sign

    Sign a string using the secret (portion of the) key.

- verify

    Check the signature on a text.

# Padding Methods

Versions prior to 0.35 allowed using pkcs1 padding for both encryption
and signature operations but has been disabled for security reasons.

While **use\_no\_padding** can be used for encryption or signature operations
**use\_pkcs1\_pss\_padding** is used for signature operations and
**use\_pkcs1\_oaep\_padding** is used for encryption operations.

Version 0.38 sets the appropriate padding for each operation unless
**use\_no\_padding** is called before either operation.

- use\_no\_padding

    Use raw RSA encryption. This mode should only be used to implement
    cryptographically sound padding modes in the application code.
    Encrypting user data directly with RSA is insecure.

- use\_pkcs1\_padding

    PKCS #1 v1.5 padding has been disabled as it is nearly impossible to use this
    padding method in a secure manner.  It is known to be vulnerable to timing
    based side channel attacks.  use\_pkcs1\_padding() results in a fatal error.

    [Marvin Attack](https://github.com/tomato42/marvin-toolkit/blob/master/README.md)

- use\_pkcs1\_oaep\_padding

    Use `EME-OAEP` padding as defined in PKCS #1 v2.0 with SHA-1, MGF1 and
    an empty encoding parameter. This mode of padding is recommended for
    all new applications.  It is the default mode used by
    `Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA` but is only valid for encryption/decryption.

- use\_pkcs1\_pss\_padding

    Use `RSA-PSS` padding as defined in PKCS#1 v2.1.  In general, RSA-PSS
    should be used as a replacement for RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5.  The module specifies
    the message digest being requested and the appropriate mgf1 setting and
    salt length for the digest.

    **Note**: RSA-PSS cannot be used for encryption/decryption and results in a
    fatal error.  Call `use_pkcs1_oaep_padding` for encryption operations. 

- use\_sslv23\_padding

    Use `PKCS #1 v1.5` padding with an SSL-specific modification that
    denotes that the server is SSL3 capable.

    Not available since OpenSSL 3.

# Hash/Digest Methods

- use\_md5\_hash

    Use the RFC 1321 MD5 hashing algorithm by Ron Rivest when signing and
    verifying messages.

    Note that this is considered **insecure**.

- use\_sha1\_hash

    Use the RFC 3174 Secure Hashing Algorithm (FIPS 180-1) when signing
    and verifying messages. This is the default, when use\_sha256\_hash is
    not available.

- use\_sha224\_hash, use\_sha256\_hash, use\_sha384\_hash, use\_sha512\_hash

    These FIPS 180-2 hash algorithms, for use when signing and verifying
    messages, are only available with newer openssl versions (>= 0.9.8).

    use\_sha256\_hash is the default hash mode when available.

- use\_ripemd160\_hash

    Dobbertin, Bosselaers and Preneel's RIPEMD hashing algorithm when
    signing and verifying messages.

- use\_whirlpool\_hash

    Vincent Rijmen und Paulo S. L. M. Barreto ISO/IEC 10118-3:2004
    WHIRLPOOL hashing algorithm when signing and verifying messages.

- size

    Returns the size, in bytes, of the key.  All encrypted text will be of
    this size, and depending on the padding mode used, the length of
    the text to be encrypted should be:

    - pkcs1\_oaep\_padding

        at most 42 bytes less than this size.

    - pkcs1\_padding or sslv23\_padding

        at most 11 bytes less than this size.

    - no\_padding

        exactly this size.

- check\_key

    This function validates the RSA key, returning a true value if the key
    is valid, and a false value otherwise.  Croaks if the key is public only.

- get\_key\_parameters

    Return `Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum` objects representing the values of `n`,
    `e`, `d`, `p`, `q`, `d mod (p-1)`, `d mod (q-1)`, and `1/q mod p`,
    where `p` and `q` are the prime factors of `n`, `e` is the public
    exponent and `d` is the private exponent.  Some of these values may return
    as `undef`; only `n` and `e` will be defined for a public key.  The
    `Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum` module must be installed for this to work.

- is\_private

    Return true if this is a private key, and false if it is private only.

# BUGS

There is a small memory leak when generating new keys of more than 512 bits.
