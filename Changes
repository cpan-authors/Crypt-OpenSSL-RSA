0.25  Sun May 20 2007 12:56:11
    - Add a LICENSE file.

    - Fix a bug reported by Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
      where encrypt could segfault if called with insufficient
      data; it now informatively croaks instead.
    - Fix a bug reported by Mark Martinec where check_key would
      segfault instead of croaking when called on a public key.
    - Fix decrypt and private_encrypt to croak instead of segfault when
      called on a public key.
    - Add an is_private method.
    - Silence a few compiler warnings about ignoring return values
      from certain BIO_* methods.

0.23  Wed Apr 12 2006 00:06:10
    - Provide 32 bytes of seeding in tests, up from 19.
    - Stop relying on implicit includes, which disappeared in the 0.98
      release of OpenSSL.
    - Apply patch from Jim Radford <radford@blackbean.org> to add support
      for SHA{224,256,384,512}

      by Paul G. Weiss <paul@weiss.name>
    - Some changes to help builds on Redhat9
    - Remove deprecated methods:
      * the no-arg new constructor - use new_from_public_key,
    new_from_private_key or Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->generate_key instead
      * load_public_key - use new_from_public_key
      * load_private_key - use new_from_private_key
      * generate_key as an instance method - use it as a class constructor
    method instead.
      * set_padding_mode - use use_no_padding, use_pkcs1_padding,
    use_pkcs1_oaep_padding, or use_sslv23_padding instead.
      * get_padding_mode
    - Eliminate all(most all) memory leaks.
    - fix email address
    - Stop returning true from methods just to indicate success.
    - Change default public exponent from 65535 to 65537

      IV, not I32, for pointers, and cast the right-hand, not
      left-hand, value when doing an assignment from an SV to an HV

0.14  Sun May 19 12:35:21
